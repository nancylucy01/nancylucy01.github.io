Hello, you can download this source code to run your own locally hosted version of OAR's Trip Wizard by downloading from github. 
Running the React App requires NodeJS and pushing changes to github requires nancylucy01's permission as well as installing git on your computer.
After downloading and installing NodeJS, you can download this source branch's zip file, navigate to it in terminal, and run "npm install" to install
package dependencies such as React, Bootstrap, MongoDB's Realm API, etc. 
After these have installed, you will be ready to run this by running the command "npm run start".
This will launch the web server at https://localhost:3000
If you make changes and want to push back to the source branch, email nancylucy01 at nancylucy02@gmail.com
To deploy to the existing page, run the command "npm run deploy" and it will publish to https://nancylucy01.github.io after a minute or so.
All data is hosted in mongodb, the rest of the website is hosted front-end only using react.
